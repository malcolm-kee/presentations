# Why The Hook

Evolution of React Composition

---

## Why Evolution?

Knowing the history helps us to know why hook is introduced by seeing the limitations of previous approaches of composition in React.

## Ver 1: Mixin

---

(Live Code)

---

Mixin starts to breakdown when you have many mixins:

- name clashing
- hard to trace where a state/methods comes from
- and it is no longer supported officially when `createReactClass` is deprecated.

---

## Ver 2: Render Props

---

(Live Code)

---

Render props has its drawback too:

1. It is unintuitive.
1. Nested component tree when you compose multiple render-props.

---

## Ver 3 (Now): Hooks

---

(Live Code)

---

Hooks are:

1. more intuitive. It's just function calls.
1. no more nested component trees.
1. no downsides of mixin because you control how the hooks are composed (you assign the variable for hooks returned).

---

## Summary

- mixins are easier to use and intuitive, but you may have name crashing and those bugs are hard to debug
- render props composes stateful logic cleanly, but it is unintuitive and hard to read
- hooks give the best of both worlds: intuitive and clean composition.
